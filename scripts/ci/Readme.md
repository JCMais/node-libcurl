# CI Scripts

Those scripts are used to build the required dependencies on CI

But you can use them to build on your own environment, you need the following packages:
- autoconf
- libtool
- m4
- pkgconfig (needed for nghttp2)
- gcc >= 4.8 or compatible clang version
```
sudo apt-get install autoconf libtool-bin m4 pkg-config groff groff-base
```
