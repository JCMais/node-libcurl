## Quick Start

> **Note**:
> - This library cannot be used in a browser, it depends on native code.
> - There is no worker threads support at the moment. See [#169](https://github.com/JCMais/node-libcurl/issues/169)

### Install
```shell
npm i node-libcurl --save
```
or
```shell
yarn add node-libcurl
```
### Simple Request - Async / Await using curly
> this API is experimental and is subject to changes without a major version bump

```javascript
const { curly } = require('node-libcurl');

const { statusCode, data, headers } = await curly.get('http://www.google.com')
```

Any option can be passed using their `FULLNAME` or a `lowerPascalCase` format:
```javascript
const querystring = require('querystring');
const { curly } = require('node-libcurl');

const { statusCode, data, headers } = await curly.post('http://httpbin.com/post', {
  postFields: querystring.stringify({
    field: 'value',
  }),
  // can use `postFields` or `POSTFIELDS`
})
```

JSON POST example:
```javascript
const { curly } = require('node-libcurl')
const { data } = await curly.post('http://httpbin.com/post', {
  postFields: JSON.stringify({ field: 'value' }),
  httpHeader: [
    'Content-Type: application/json',
    'Accept: application/json'
  ],
})

console.log(data)
```

### Simple Request - Using Curl class
```javascript
const { Curl } = require('node-libcurl');

const curl = new Curl();

curl.setOpt('URL', 'www.google.com');
curl.setOpt('FOLLOWLOCATION', true);

curl.on('end', function (statusCode, data, headers) {
  console.info(statusCode);
  console.info('---');
  console.info(data.length);
  console.info('---');
  console.info(this.getInfo( 'TOTAL_TIME'));
  
  this.close();
});

curl.on('error', curl.close.bind(curl));
curl.perform();
```

### Setting HTTP headers

Pass an array of strings specifying headers
```javascript
curl.setOpt(Curl.option.HTTPHEADER,
  ['Content-Type: application/x-amz-json-1.1'])
```

### Form Submission (Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded)
```javascript
const querystring = require('querystring');
const { Curl } = require('node-libcurl');

const curl = new Curl();
const close = curl.close.bind(curl);

curl.setOpt(Curl.option.URL, '127.0.0.1/upload');
curl.setOpt(Curl.option.POST, true)
curl.setOpt(Curl.option.POSTFIELDS, querystring.stringify({
  field: 'value',
}));

curl.on('end', close);
curl.on('error', close);
```

### MultiPart Upload / HttpPost libcurl Option (Content-Type: multipart/form-data)

```javascript
const { Curl } = require('node-libcurl');

const curl = new Curl();
const close = curl.close.bind(curl);

curl.setOpt(Curl.option.URL, '127.0.0.1/upload.php');
curl.setOpt(Curl.option.HTTPPOST, [
    { name: 'input-name', file: '/file/path', type: 'text/html' },
    { name: 'input-name2', contents: 'field-contents' }
]);

curl.on('end', close);
curl.on('error', close);
```

### Binary Data

When requesting binary data make sure to do one of these:
- Pass your own `WRITEFUNCTION` (https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_WRITEFUNCTION.html):
```javascript
curl.setOpt('WRITEFUNCTION', (buffer, size, nmemb) => {
  // something
})
```
- Enable one of the following flags:
```javascript
curl.enable(CurlFeature.NoDataParsing)
// or
curl.enable(CurlFeature.Raw)
```

The reasoning behind this is that by default, the `Curl` instance will try to decode the received data and headers to utf8 strings, as can be seen here: https://github.com/JCMais/node-libcurl/blob/b55b13529c9d11fdcdd7959137d8030b39427800/lib/Curl.ts#L391

For more examples check the [examples folder](./examples).

## API

API documentation for the latest stable version is available at [https://node-libcurl-docs.netlify.app/modules/_lib_index_.html](https://node-libcurl-docs.netlify.app/modules/_lib_index_.html).

Develop branch documentation is available at [https://develop--node-libcurl-docs.netlify.app/modules/_lib_index_.html](https://develop--node-libcurl-docs.netlify.app/modules/_lib_index_.html).

This library provides Typescript type definitions.

Almost all [CURL options](https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/curl_easy_setopt.html) are supported, if you pass one that is not, an error will be thrown.

For more usage examples check the [examples folder](./examples).

## Special Notes

### `READFUNCTION` option

The buffer passed as first parameter to the callback set with the [`READFUNCTION`](https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_READFUNCTION.html) option is initialized with the size libcurl is using in their upload buffer (which can be set with [`UPLOAD_BUFFERSIZE`](https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_UPLOAD_BUFFERSIZE.html)), this is initialized using `node::Buffer::Data(buf);` which is basically the same than `Buffer#allocUnsafe` and therefore, it has all the implications as to its correct usage: https://nodejs.org/pt-br/docs/guides/buffer-constructor-deprecation/#regarding-buffer-allocunsafe

So, be careful, make sure to return **exactly** the amount of data you have written to the buffer on this callback. Only that specific amount is going to be copied and handed over to libcurl.

## Benchmarks

See [./benchmark](./benchmark)

## Security

See [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md)

## Supported Libcurl Versions

The addon is only tested against libcurl version `7.50.0` and the latest one available.

The code itself is made to compile with any version greater than `7.32.0`, any libcurl version lower than that is **not** supported.

## For Enterprise

`node-libcurl` is available as part of the [Tidelift Subscription](https://tidelift.com/subscription/pkg/npm-node-libcurl?utm_source=npm-node-libcurl&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=enterprise&utm_term=repo).

The maintainers of node-libcurl and thousands of other packages are working with Tidelift to deliver commercial support and maintenance for the open source dependencies you use to build your applications. Save time, reduce risk, and improve code health, while paying the maintainers of the exact dependencies you use. [Learn more.](https://tidelift.com/subscription/pkg/npm-node-libcurl?utm_source=npm-node-libcurl&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=enterprise&utm_term=repo)

## Detailed Installation

The latest version of this package has prebuilt binaries (thanks to [node-pre-gyp](https://github.com/mapbox/node-pre-gyp/)) 
 available for:
* Node.js: Latest two versions on active LTS (see https://github.com/nodejs/Release)
* Electron: Latest 3 major versions
* NW.js (node-webkit): Latest 3 major (minor for nw.js case) versions

And on the following platforms:
* Linux 64 bits
* Mac OS X 64 bits
* Windows 32 and 64 bits

Installing with `yarn add node-libcurl` or `npm install node-libcurl` should download a prebuilt binary and no compilation will be needed. However if you are trying to install on `nw.js` or `electron` additional steps will be required, check their corresponding section below.

The prebuilt binary is statically built with the following library versions, features and protocols (library versions may change between Node.js versions):
```
Version: libcurl/7.73.0 OpenSSL/1.1.1g zlib/1.2.11 brotli/1.0.7 zstd/1.4.9 c-ares/1.16.1 libidn2/2.1.1 libssh2/1.9.0 nghttp2/1.41.0
Protocols: dict, file, ftp, ftps, gopher, http, https, imap, imaps, ldap, ldaps, mqtt, pop3, pop3s, rtsp, scp, sftp, smb, smbs, smtp, smtps, telnet, tftp
Features: AsynchDNS, IDN, IPv6, Largefile, NTLM, NTLM_WB, SSL, libz, brotli, TLS-SRP, HTTP2, UnixSockets, HTTPS-proxy
```

If there is no prebuilt binary available that matches your system, or if the installation fails, then you will need an environment capable of compiling Node.js addons, which means:
- [python 2.7](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7) installed
- updated C++ compiler able to compile C++11, or if building Electron >= 11 / NW.js >= 0.50, C++17 (see the [Electron >= 11 / NW.js >= 0.50](#electron--11--nwjs--050) section below).

If you don't want to use the prebuilt binary even if it works on your system, you can pass a flag when installing:
> With `npm`
```sh
npm install node-libcurl --build-from-source
```
> With `yarn`
```sh
npm_config_build_from_source=true yarn add node-libcurl
```

### Important Notes on Prebuilt Binaries / Direct Installation

> Those notes are not important when building on Windows

The prebuilt binaries are statically linked with `brotli`, `libidn2`, `libssh2`, `openLDAP`, `OpenSSL` `nghttp2`, `zstd` and `zlib`.

The `brotli`, `nghttp2`, `OpenSSL` and `zlib` versions **must** match the version Node.js uses, this is necessary to avoid any possible issues by mixing library symbols of different versions, since Node.js also exports some of the symbols of their deps.

In case you are building the addon yourself with the libraries mentioned above, you must make sure their version is ABI compatible with the one Node.js uses, otherwise you are probably going to hit a Segmentation Fault.

If you want to build a statically linked version of the addon yourself, you need to pass the `curl_static_build=true` flag when calling install.

> If using `npm`:
```sh
npm install node-libcurl --build-from-source --curl_static_build=true
```
> If using `yarn`:
```sh
npm_config_build_from_source=true npm_config_curl_static_build=true yarn add node-libcurl
```

The build process will use `curl-config` available on path, if you want to overwrite it to your own libcurl installation one, you can set the `curl_config_bin` variable, like mentioned above for `curl_static_build`.

And if you don't want to use `curl-config`, you can pass two extra variables to control the build process:
- `curl_include_dirs`
    Space separated list of directories to search for header files
- `curl_libraries`
    Space separated list of flags to pass to the linker

#### Missing Packages

The statically linked version currently does not have support for `GSS-API`, `SPNEGO`, `KERBEROS`, `RTMP`, `Metalink`, `PSL` and `Alt-svc`.

The scripts to build Kerberos exists on the `./scripts/ci` folder, but it was removed for two reasons:
- If built with Heimdal, the addon becomes too big
- If built with MIT Kerberos, the addon would be bound to their licensing terms.

### Electron / NW.js

If building for a `Electron` or `NW.js` you need to pass additional parameters to the install command.

If you do not want to use the prebuilt binary, pass the `npm_config_build_from_source=true` / `--build-from-source` flag to the install command.

#### NW.js (aka node-webkit)
For building from source on NW.js you first need to make sure you have nw-gyp installed globally:
`yarn global add nw-gyp` or `npm i -g nw-gyp`

> If on Windows, you also need addition steps, currently the available win_delay_load_hook.cc on `nw-gyp` is not working with this addon, so it's necessary to apply a patch to it. The patch can be found on `./scripts/ci/patches/win_delay_load_hook.cc.patch`, and should be applied to the file on `<nw-gyp-folder>/src/win_delay_load_hook.cc`.

Then:
> yarn
```
npm_config_runtime=node-webkit npm_config_target=0.38.2 yarn add node-libcurl
```
> npm
```bash
npm install node-libcurl --runtime=node-webkit --target=0.38.2 --save
```

where `--target` is the current version of NW.js you are using

#### Electron (aka atom-shell)

> yarn
```bash
npm_config_runtime=electron npm_config_target=X.Y.Z npm_config_disturl=https://www.electronjs.org/headers yarn add node-libcurl
```

> npm
```bash
npm install node-libcurl --runtime=electron --target=X.Y.Z --disturl=https://www.electronjs.org/headers --save
```

Where `--target` is the version of electron you are using, in our case, we are just using the version returned by the locally installed `electron` binary.

You can also put those args in a .npmrc file, like so:

```bash
runtime = electron
target = 5.0.1
target_arch = x64
dist_url = https://atom.io/download/atom-shell
```

#### Electron >= 11 / NW.js >= 0.50

If you are building for Electron >= 11 or NW.js >= 0.50 you need to set the build process to use the C++17 std, you can do that by passing the variable `node_libcurl_cpp_std=c++17`. The way you do that depends if you are using `npm` or `yarn`:

> If using `npm`:
```sh
npm install node-libcurl --node_libcurl_cpp_std=c++17 <...other args...>
```
> If using `yarn`:
```sh
npm_config_node_libcurl_cpp_std=c++17 <...other args...> yarn add node-libcurl
```

### Building on Linux

To build the addon on linux based systems you must have:
- gcc >= 4.8
- libcurl dev files
- python 2.7

If you are on a debian based system, you can get those by running:
```bash
sudo apt-get install python libcurl4-openssl-dev build-essential
```

If you don't want to use the libcurl version shipped with your system, since it's probably very old, you can install libcurl from source, for the addon to use that libcurl version you can use the variable mentioned above, `curl_config_bin`.

In case you want some examples check the CI configuration files ([`.travis.yml`](./.travis.yml), [`.circleci/config.yml`](./.circleci/config.yml)) and the [`scripts/ci/`](./scripts/ci) folder.

### Building on macOS

On macOS you must have:
- macOS >= 11.6 (Big Sur)
- Xcode Command Line Tools

You can check if you have Xcode Command Line Tools be running:
```sh
xcode-select -p
```

It should return their path, in case it returns nothing, you must install it by running:
```sh
xcode-select --install
```

#### Xcode >= 10 | macOS >= Mojave
In case you have errors installing the addon from source, and you are using macOS version >= Mojave, check if the error you are receiving is the following one:
```
  CXX(target) Release/obj.target/node_libcurl/src/node_libcurl.o
  clang: error: no such file or directory: '/usr/include'
```

If that is the case, it's because newer versions of the Command Line Tools does not add the `/usr/include` folder by default. Check [Xcode 10 release notes](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode_release_notes/xcode_10_release_notes#3035624) for details.

The `/usr/include` is now available on `$(xcrun --show-sdk-path)/usr/include`. To correctly build libcurl you then need to pass that path to the `npm_config_curl_include_dirs` environment variable:
```
npm_config_curl_include_dirs="$(xcrun --show-sdk-path)/usr/include" yarn add node-libcurl
```

### Building on Windows

If installing using a prebuilt binary you only need to have the [visual c++ 2017 runtime library](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#microsoft-visual-c-redistributable-for-visual-studio-2017).

If building from source, you must have:
- Python 2.7
- [Visual Studio >= 2017](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
- [nasm](https://www.nasm.us/)

Python 2.7 and the Visual Studio compiler can be installed by running:
```sh
npm install --global --production windows-build-tools
```

`nasm` can be obtained from their website, which is linked above, or using chocolatey:
```
cinst nasm
```

Currently there is no support to use other libcurl version than the one provided by the [curl-for-windows](https://github.com/JCMais/curl-for-windows) submodule (help is appreciated on adding this feature).

An important note about building the addon on Windows is that we have to do some "hacks" with the header files included by `node-gyp`/`nw-gyp`. The reason for that is because as we are using a standalone version of OpenSSL, we don't want to use the OpenSSL headers provided by Node.js, which are by default added to `<nw-gyp-or-node-gyp-folder>/include/node/openssl`, so what we do is that before compilation that folder is renamed to `openssl.disabled`. After a successful installation the folder is renamed back to their original name, **however** if any error happens during compilation the folder will stay renamed until the addon is compiled successfully. More info on why that was needed and some context can be found on issue [#164](https://github.com/JCMais/node-libcurl/issues/164).
